Adding comments

- generate a migration: create_comments
    - user_id (integer)
    - body (text)
    - post_id (integer)

- create a Comment model
    - move the index of comments to posts#show
        - controller
            - load only comments for a single post
            - move logic from comments#index to posts#show
   - views
        - move contents of comments/index.html.erb to posts/show.html.erb
    - move the new comment form to posts#show 
        - autopopulate the post_id
    - pick the user for the comment with a drop-down

Options in Rails:
Migration -- just the migration
Model -- model + migration
Controller -- controller + views + routes
Resource -- model + controller
Scaffold -- migration + model + controller + views + routes
Scaffold_controller -- controller + views + routes (what's the difference with controller?)

Let's try scaffold and customize it.

rails generate scaffold comment user:references post:references body:text --no-jbuilder --pretend
